Still a very much work in progress

Been developing this script to help us copy the general attributes of the transform 
and shape node in lights and geo on the assembly files to output to a file and import 
it back into the database 

Also the script works maya files that have name spaces in the light objects and removes them 


1.  First create directory on the c drive with the name C:\LIGHTING folder for all the text files to go

2.  Then select the lights whose attributes you want to copy into a text, name the file.

3.  Select which of the attributes you want to copy and hit enter.

4.  Open up the text file, to copy/paste the mel into mel script editor. 

5. Test
